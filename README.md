# The Input Transfer Project - SendMeBread

## My irrational goal is to make it so that other computers (clients) can input on one computer (the host). Not just typing, but the cursor as well. *Every input will be included.*

### Making

For Windows:

Install a C++ Compiler (minGW-w64 recommended)

To install minGW-w64:

Install MSYS2: <https://www.msys2.org/>

Install minGW-w64 inside the MSYS2 environment:

```bash
pacman -S --needed base-devel mingw-w64-ucrt-x86_64-toolchain
```

To add C:/msys64/mingw64/bin to PATH:

Press Windows + R (this will open the Run Prompt), then type sysdm, the press enter. Open the "Advanced" tab and click "Environment Variables."

Install CMake: <https://cmake.org/download/>

For Debian/Debian based systems:
